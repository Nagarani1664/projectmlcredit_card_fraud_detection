# projectmlcredit_card_fraud_detection
This repository contains code and documentation for a machine learning project aimed at detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.

Project Objectives:

Develop and evaluate machine learning models to accurately classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
Address the challenge of imbalanced datasets, where fraudulent transactions are typically a small minority.
Investigate and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Implement feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC).
Project Structure:

data/: Contains the credit card transaction dataset (e.g., CSV files).
src/: Contains Python source code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
data_preprocessing.py: Functions for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.
model_training.py: Functions for training and evaluating machine learning models.
utils.py: Helper functions for data loading, visualization, and model evaluation.
notebooks/: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.
models/: Stores trained model files (e.g., pickled models).
results/: Stores model evaluation results and visualizations.
README.md: This file.
